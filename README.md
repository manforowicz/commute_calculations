# Commute Calculations

Some quick personal calculations I did to compare the cost of
commuting to college by car, bus, or living in student housing.

Output when I last ran this script:
```
Value of time I waste by commuting: $35.00/hr  ;)

Cost per school day (including time wasted) to...
Live in apartment:  $92.73
Commute by car:     $47.30
Commute by bus:     $45.50
